        journalEntry: "Helped Paula Nator today — poor thing’s heart was fluttering like a panicked moth in a lantern. A carefully brewed dose of foxglove settled her heartbeat into a calm, steady rhythm. She could finally finish her stargazing without fainting on the telescope again. In thanks, she gifted me a Spring Shard, said it shimmered into her pocket during a particularly lovely heartbeat. Magic has good timing, it seems."
